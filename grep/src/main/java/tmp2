The '''Mathews Mr Easy''' is an [[United States|American]] [[homebuilt aircraft]] that was designed by Lyle Mathews and associates and produced by the [[Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Association]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]]. It was the sixth and final design of Mathews. The aircraft is supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot;&gt;Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition'', page 286. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. {{ISBN|0-9636409-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VULA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://vula.org/blueprint_pricelist.html|title = Blueprints Price List|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = Perkins | first = Scott, V.U.L.A. Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Assoc. |authorlink = |year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the US [[FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles]] rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The aircraft has a standard empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

Mr Easy features a [[strut-braced]] and [[Flying wires|cable-braced]] [[biplane]] layout, a single-seat, open cockpit, fixed [[conventional landing gear]] and a single engine in [[pusher configuration]], mounted above the tail boom tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

The aircraft is made from bolted-together [[aluminum]] tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in [[Aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|24.00|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span wing has a wing area of {{convert|145.0|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The  standard engine used is the {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 447]] [[two-stroke]] twin-cylinder powerplant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

Mr Easy has a typical empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|485|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|235|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. With full fuel of {{convert|5|u.s.gal}} the payload for the pilot and baggage is {{convert|205|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off and landing roll with a {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine is {{convert|175|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

The designer estimates the construction time from the supplied plans as 250&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot; /&gt;

==Operational history==

In the United States ultralights are not required to be registered, and in April 2014 no examples were in fact [[Aircraft registration|registered]] in the United States with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], although a total of two had been registered at one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAAReg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/AcftRef_Results.aspx?Mfrtxt=&amp;Modeltxt=MR+EASY&amp;PageNo=1|title = Make / Model Inquiry Results|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Little River Turnpike Bridge''' carries [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;50]] (US&amp;nbsp;50) across the [[Little River (Goose Creek)|Little River]] near [[Aldie, Virginia|Aldie]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]. The two-arch masonry bridge was built in 1826 by the [[Little River Turnpike]] Company, which built the roadway that is now US&amp;nbsp;50. The costs of the bridge were apparently shared between that company and the Ashley's Gap Turnpike Company. It is one of a small number of masonry arch bridges still carrying a major through road in the state. It is about {{convert|108|ft|m}} long and {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/053-0244_Little_River_Turnpike_Bridge_2007_draft_Nomination.pdf|title=NRHP draft nomination for Little River Turnpike Bridge|publisher=Virginia DHR|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge has received only modest visible modifications since its construction. Concrete caps have been installed on upper surface elements, and the arch underside has also been protected with shotcrete.  The upstream central pier has had a concrete fender added to protect it from debris and scouring. The downstream parapet wall was damaged by a truck in 1998 and reconstructed, and in 2004 reinforcing metal rods were injected into the rubble of the bridge to help distribute the active load. {{As of|2014}}, the bridge has no weight limit.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

The bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;/&gt;

&quot;'''Take Me to Church'''&quot; is a song by [[Irish people|Irish]] musician [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]]. It was released on his debut [[extended play]] (EP) and later his [[Hozier (album)|self-titled debut album]] (2014). The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013 as a free download. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents' home in [[Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland]]. A mid-tempo [[Soul music|soul]] song, its lyrics use religious terminology to describe a romantic relationship. The song first caught the attention of independent label [[Rubyworks Records|Rubyworks]], where producer [[Rob Kirwan]] overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track: Andrew Hozier-Byrne ([[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]]) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.{{Citation needed|reason=album liner notes disagree|date=February 2017}}

The song's [[music video]] has contributed to its widespread popularity. The clip, directed by [[Brendan Canty]] and Conal Thomson of small production company Feel Good Lost, follows the relationship between two men and the subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its [[YouTube]] release in September 2013, the video quickly began to go [[Viral video|viral]], leading to Hozier's subsequent license with [[Columbia Records]] US and [[Island Records]] UK.

In 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity, topping the charts in 12 countries and reaching the top 10 in 21 other territories. Aided by music platforms [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]] and [[Spotify]] to become a rock radio hit in the US, the song spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the [[List of number-one Billboard Rock Songs|Hot Rock Songs]] chart, tied with [[Imagine Dragons]]{{'}} &quot;[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]&quot; as the longest-running number-one in its chart-history (at the time), later crossing over to the all-genre [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at number two in December 2014. The song was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]]. The song has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] in the US.

On 16 April 2016, Hozier released the original ''Take Me Church EP'' on special edition 12-inch vinyl picture disc for [[Record Store Day]] UK; this was the first time the EP was available as a physical release.

==Background==
In 2013, Hozier was a struggling musician, often seen in [[Dublin]]-area open mic nights. During this period, he penned &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; at his parents' home in [[Bray, County Wicklow]], Ireland, and recorded a rough demo in their attic with a programmed backing track.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite journal| author=Andy Greene| date =January 29, 2015| title =Behind Hozier's Unlikely Rise| journal =[[Rolling Stone]] | location =New York City | issn =0035-791X | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/behind-hoziers-unlikely-rise-20150129| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the song after a bad breakup.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite journal| author= Rob LeDonne| date =October 10, 2014| title =For Hozier and 'Take Me To Church,' a Four-Year Overnight Success Story| journal =[[The New York Observer]] | issn = 1052-2948 | url =http://observer.com/2014/10/for-hozier-and-take-me-to-church-a-four-year-overnight-success-story/| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The vocals were recorded in my attic at 2 o'clock in the morning. So it's a real homemade job&quot;, he later remarked.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite journal| author= Andrew R. Chow| date =November 21, 2014| title =Protesting Injustice, Accepting Fame| journal =[[The New York Times]] | issn = 1052-2948 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/music/hozier-on-protest-pop.html?_r=0| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It caught the attention of independent label [[Rubyworks Records|Rubyworks]], who paired him with producer Rob Kirwan. The song was overdubbed with live instrumentation, but the original demo vocals remained, as Kirwan found them &quot;powerful&quot; enough to remain.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

For the Grammys, Hozier performed the song with [[Annie Lennox]], along with Annie's cover of &quot;[[I Put A Spell On You]]&quot;.

==Lyrical interpretation==
{{Listen

}}

Lyrically, &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; is a metaphor, with the protagonist comparing his lover to religion. The song grew out of Hozier's frustration with the [[Catholic Church]]'s teachings which, although he himself was raised in the Protestant Quaker faith, dominated the social and political outlook of the Irish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Regan|first1=Brendan|title=RTÉ's new season is a mixed blessing|url=http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/rt%C3%A9%E2%80%99s-new-season-mixed-blessing|website=The Irish Catholic|accessdate=27 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616183744/http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/rt%C3%A9%E2%80%99s-new-season-mixed-blessing|archive-date=16 June 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Growing up, I always saw the hypocrisy of the Catholic church&quot;, Hozier said in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. &quot;The history speaks for itself and I grew incredibly frustrated and angry. I essentially just put that into my words.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Hozier stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I found the experience of falling in love or being in love was a death, a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment–if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes–everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2014/09/20/hozier |title=Hozier: An Interview |work= [[The Irish Times]] |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Mullally, Una}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', he elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sexuality, and sexual orientation – regardless of orientation – is just natural. An act of sex is one of the most human things. But an organization like the church, say, through its doctrine, would undermine humanity by successfully teaching shame about sexual orientation – that it is sinful, or that it offends God. The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/03/qa-hozier-on-gay-rights-sex-good-hair.html |title=Q&amp;A: Hozier on Gay Rights, Sexuality, and Good Hair | work= [[NY Magazine]] |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The song draws inspiration from [[atheist]] author [[Christopher Hitchens]] and paraphrases the poet [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Fulke Greville]]'s verse &quot;Created sick, commanded to be sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitchens1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/31/hozier-best-vocalists-female-take-me-to-church|title=Hozier: The best vocalists I can think of are female}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitchens2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yucatanrecords.com/artist-of-the-week/hozier|title=Hozier|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221111204/http://www.yucatanrecords.com/artist-of-the-week/hozier|archive-date=2015-02-21|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitchens3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11259127/Hozier-interview-Im-a-gangly-introvert.html|title=Hozier Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==

The song rose in prominence alongside its viral music video, attracting A&amp;R representatives from major labels in a bidding war to sign Hozier. He was signed by Justin Eshak of Columbia Records, who later opined that the song became a hit due to a shift on pop radio, spearheaded by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]: &quot;The music is connecting because when it gets on the air it's such a sharp juxtaposition to the existing material on top 40 radio.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; The song first experienced chart success in his native Ireland, climbing the charts in October 2013 and eventually reached number two on [[Irish Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=observer/&gt;

In May 2014, Hozier performed the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/hozier-wows-us-on-david-letterman-with-rendition-of-take-me-to-church-30274220.html |title=Hozier wows US on David Letterman with rendition of Take Me to Church |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to US [[modern rock]] radio on 24 June 2014 by [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alternative&quot;/&gt; It eventually reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks in December 2014 and January 2015, behind [[Taylor Swift]]'s &quot;[[Blank Space]]&quot;, while becoming his first top 10 single there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6327834/hot-100-taylor-swift-blank-space-meghan-trainor-hozier|title=Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space' No. 1 on Hot 100 for Second Week|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 26, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2015, the song has sold 4,270,000 copies in the US.&lt;ref name=us_sales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801063634/http://hitsdailydouble.com/news%26id%3D297039 |archivedate=August 1, 2015 |url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&amp;id=297039 |title=YTD Marketshare at the Seven-Month Mark |website=[[Hits (magazine)|HITS Daily Double]] |publisher=HITS Digital Ventures |date=July 31, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track has since reached top five in many other countries including peaking at number two in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

The song initially attracted US attention in [[Nashville]] via an [[adult album alternative]] radio station. From there, it became the top song for the area on music identification application [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]], which led to its appearance on a local top 40 station. &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; achieved widespread popularity in the United States between the summer and fall of 2014.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

Despite the song's popularity on YouTube, the song achieved more listens on [[Spotify]],&lt;ref name=&quot;spot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6327661/spotify-seems-to-be-gaining-on-youtubes-streaming | title=Spotify Seems to Be Gaining on YouTube's Streaming Dominance| author = William Gruger | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = November 24, 2014 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the service's most-streamed song of 2014, achieving 87 million listens.&lt;ref name=&quot;spot1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/hoziers-take-me-to-church-is-the-most-streamed-song-of-2014-9915268.html | title=Hozier's 'Take Me To Church' named Spotify's most viral song of 2014| author = Roisin O'Connor | work=[[The Independent]] | date = December 10, 2014 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The concept for the &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; music video was the result of a collaboration between Hozier, Brendan Canty and his writing partner Emmet O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/man-behind-hoziers-take-church-6138156 |title=Man behind Hozier's Take Me To Church video hoping to crack the film industry after getting two nominations at the MTV VMAs |work= [[Irish Mirror]] |date=26 July 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015 |author=Ward, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of Feel Good Lost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Eoin|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/take-me-to-fame-hoziers-cork-made-video-310955.html|newspaper=Irish Examiner|title=How a €1,500 video made in Cork made Hozier :the biggest name in music}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on 25 September 2013. The video, shot in [[grayscale]] on location at Inniscarra Dam in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], follows a same-sex relationship in Russia and the violently homophobic backlash that ensues when the community learns of one of the men's sexuality. The video had a budget of 500 Euros.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Lauren (20 July 2014). &quot;Has the Internet Killed the Music Video?&quot; ''Sunday Times'' (London). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The song went viral following its release. &quot;I remember someone texting me to say it was getting 10,000 views an hour&quot;, he recalled.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; The song achieved 230,000 YouTube views within two weeks.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Hozier stated, &quot;The song was always about humanity at its most natural, and how that is undermined ceaselessly by religious organizations and those who would have us believe they act in its interests. What [[LGBT rights in Russia|has been seen growing in Russia]] is no less than nightmarish. I proposed bringing these themes into the story and Brendan liked the idea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/hozier-take-me-to-church_n_3991405.html |title=Hozier's 'Take Me To Church' Echoes Russian LGBT Violence |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |date=26 September 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Nichols, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://state.ie/features/video-premiere-hozier-take-me-to-church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925204947/http://www.state.ie/features/video-premiere-hozier-take-me-to-church |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 September 2013 |title=Video Premiere: Hozier – Take Me To Church |work=[[State (magazine)|State]] |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Udell, Phil }}&lt;/ref&gt;
